# Copilot instructions — To-Do App

Quick, actionable guidance to help an AI coding agent be productive in this repository.

1. Repo snapshot

- This repository currently contains a single `README.md` at the project root and no obvious build or language files (no `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.). The README is minimal.

2. High-level goal

- The project is titled "To-Do-App" (see `README.md`). There is no existing source tree. Before adding frameworks or substantial scaffolding, ask the repo owner which language, framework, and target platform they expect (web, mobile, CLI).

3. What to inspect first

- `README.md` — current project description (minimal). Use it to confirm intent.
- Root directory — look for any hidden configs or lockfiles that indicate language choice.

4. Constraints & conventions (discoverable)

- Do not assume a tech stack. There are no package manifests; any addition of a build tool or framework must be proposed in a short plan and confirmed by the owner.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible: prefer adding a new top-level `src/` folder and a small README update rather than restructuring the repo without approval.

5. Common actions & examples

- If asked to scaffold a simple web To-Do app, propose two small options and ask which to choose. Example proposals:
  - Minimal static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS in `src/` (no package manager). Good for quick demos.
  - Small React app with Vite and `package.json` (if owner wants JS tooling).
- Example commit/PR pattern (follow):
  - Branch: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/add-vanilla-todo`)
  - Commit message: `feat: add lightweight vanilla-js todo scaffold`
  - PR description: 1–2 sentences of intent, list of files added, how to run locally, and any feedback requested.

6. Build/test/debug workflows

- There are no discoverable build/test commands. Before adding tests or CI, ask which test framework to use. If the owner requests Node/React, create a minimal `npm`-based workflow and include simple smoke tests.

7. Integration points & external dependencies

- No integrations detected. If adding third-party services (databases, auth, hosting), summarize the trade-offs and request approval before implementing.

8. Safety and scope guidance for the agent

- When in doubt, ask. Non-trivial choices (language, build tooling, hosting, database) require owner confirmation.
- Avoid making opinionated, cross-cutting changes (monorepo layouts, CI setup) without a short plan and approval.

9. Minimal "contract" for PRs generated by the agent

- Inputs: a short issue or instruction from the owner describing desired functionality and preferred stack.
- Outputs: a small, self-contained change (<= ~200 lines added) with updated `README.md` containing run instructions.
- Error modes: missing owner preferences — stop and ask; conflicting changes — open a discussion in PR.

10. When to ask the owner (examples)

- If README doesn't state language/framework.
- If proposing to add a package manager, CI, or external service.

If anything above is unclear or you'd like opinionated scaffolding (React/Vite, Express API, SQLite persistence), tell me which option(s) you prefer and I will create a small, reversible scaffold and a follow-up PR.
